Description: 

    One function of a paralleled algorithm for multivariate outlier detection named modified Stahel-Donoho estimators is contained.  The function is for elliptically distributed datasets.  Outliers are recognized based on Mahalanobis distance. 

    The function is for higher dimensional datasets which cannot be handled by a single core function included in RMSD,  See Wada and Tsubaki (2013) <DOI: 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.86> for the detail of the algorithm.
