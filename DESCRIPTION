Description: 
    A parallel function for multivariate outlier detection named modified Stahel-Donoho estimators is contained.  The function is for elliptically distributed datasets and recognizes outliers based on Mahalanobis distance. 
    The function is for higher dimensional datasets that cannot be handled by a single core function included in RMSD.  See Wada and Tsubaki (2013) <doi:10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.86> for the detail of the algorithm.
